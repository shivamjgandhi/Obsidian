**Structure**
- The complete BCR has two parts, the Hc/Lc parts outside the cell that recognize the antigen and Iga and Igb inside the cell that signal but can't tell what's going on outside
- Crosslinking of BCR is important since it gets Iga and Igb moles to set off a chain reaction inside the cell

**Function**
- [[complement]] on the surface of an invader can amplify the BCR signal
- Activation has two paths. Both require 2 keys. The first is clustering of the BCR and associated signaling molecules
	- [[T-cell]] dependent activation has [[T-helper cells]] activating the B cells via CD40
	- In response to certain antigens, naive B-cells can also be activated independently. The second key is now a [[Toll-like receptor]] that says there's danger. This method is antigen specific
- Allowing some antigens to activate B cells without T cell help increases the universe of antigens that the adaptive immune system can react against
