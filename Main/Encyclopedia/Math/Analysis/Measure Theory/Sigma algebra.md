A sigma algebra on a set X is a collection of subsets of X that includes X itself that is closed under complement, closed under countable unions.

**Intuition**
- Best way is to think of this in terms of probability theory. Your sigma algebra on a space defines what events you can take probabilities of. When you combine it with the original space X as $(\Sigma, X)$, you get a measurable space.
