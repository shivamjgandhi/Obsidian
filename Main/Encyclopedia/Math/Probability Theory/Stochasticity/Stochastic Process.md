For a given probability space $(\Omega, F, P)$ with $\Omega$ sample space, $F$ the [[Sigma algebra]] and $P$ the probability measure, and a measurable space $(S, \Sigma)$, a stochastic process is a collection of S-valued random variables that can be written as $\{X(t): t \in T\}$

**Intuition**
- Each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set T. You can think of it as a process that has random behavior at time $t$ but its random behavior is unique to that time $t$. 
- Want to note that the index set does not have to be a time set $T$. For example, we can use the unit ball to index a stochastic process.
