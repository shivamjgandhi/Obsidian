**Main Points**
- [[myofibroblasts]] are a heterogeneous population of cells defined by expression of contractile proteins and abundant release of extracellular matrix proteins
- [[Epigenetic]] modification causes a feed-forward loop in myofibroblasts 
- [[Systemic sclerosis]] has an autoimmune nature
- Mutations in genes corresponding to telomere length account for disease in up to 25% of patients with IPF
- Initial microvascular injury leads to [[fibrosis]]
- Cells of epithelial origin considered the site of primary injury in most forms of fibrotic hepatic and renal disease
- Early deposition of [[macrophages]] reduces tissue injury. Later depletion leads to increased injury. Therefore they have different roles at different stages
- [[IFN-gamma]] released from T_H1 cells is pro-inflammatory and antifibrotic in IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). May also promote vascular damage in systemic sclerosis
- PD1+ CD4+ [[T-cell]] increased in fibrotic diseases
- Antibodies have been seen to be drivers of fibrotic disease
- Lipofibroblasts - fibroblast population rich in neutral lipids, are a subpopulation of resident fibroblasts
- Resident fibroblasts are more abundant in skin as an organ rich in collagen and fiber
- TGFbeta is a master regulator of physiological and pathological tissue repair responses

**Possible Things to Investigate**
- We need a deeper understanding of cell populations and inflammatory mediators involved in fibrotic responses regulation to shed light on organ-specific responses
- Focus a lot of research on myofibroblasts
- Look into adipogenic precursor cells
- Do we have enrichment of resident fibroblasts near fibrosis for Crohn's disease?

**Questions**
-  Are we talking about cell type purely based on gene expression? Why aren't other factors considered when classifying cell type?
-  Do we ever look at transcriptomics and genomics together?
-  Are there patterns for function in master regulator genes?
