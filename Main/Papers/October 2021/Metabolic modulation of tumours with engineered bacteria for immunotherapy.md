**Main Points**
- Found [[metabolites]] related to [[tumor]] [[T-cell]] response and then [[genetically engineer]]ed bacteria to be able to turn the ammonia waste product into the required L-arginine for [[immunotherapy]]
- There's an issue of size of tumors in colonization of the tumor

**Possible things to investigate**
- [[metabolites]] related to IBD 
- Bacteria that can metabolize existing chemicals for an immune response

**Questions**
- How hard would it be to make such a database?
