**Main Points**
- Wanted to understand the gut microbial [[l-dopa]] and [[dopamine]] metabolism
- AFMT + L-dopa + carbidopa --> peak serum concentration of L-dopa
- L-dopa turns into dopamine
- 1-5% of L-dopa gets through the BBB
- Lower pH = upper small intestine = L-dopa decarboxylase
- E. faecalis does the decarboxylation of L-dopa to dopamine
- The gut microbial species identity is often not predictive of metabolic functions
- Pos. 506 ~ metabolism or not
- E. lenta led to the production of m-tyramine from dopamine 
- [[Small intestinal]]l tyrDC abundance correlates with plasma L-dopa levels
- Pyridoxal phosphate = active form of vitamin B6. Some tyrosine decarboxylase is pyridoxal phosphate dependent --> diet mechanism on dopamine

**Possible things to investigate**
- Want to study whether certain foods/drugs are confounding variables in Parkinson's because food and drugs affect the microbiome

**Questions**
- What is the mechanism for crossing the [[Blood brain barrier]]?
- Why is [[tyrosine]] the preferred substrate?
- How does LCMS work?

**Extra notes**
- tyrosine important catecholamines
- vitamin B6 is an essential vitamin. Essential vitamins often produced by gut mb
- in the intestine there's a pH gradient. Upper more acidic (think stomach). Large intestine is less acidic
- Interesting thing to do would be to infer small intestinal mb (or measure it) since most mb measurements are from the stool
- Could see interesting things from Deb Hung's experiments. They're doing mb experiments so we'll see what species they get
- Wanna look up what can and cannot cross the blood brain barrier
