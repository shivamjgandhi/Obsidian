**Main Points**
- Horizontal Gene Transfer ([[HGT]]) allows an organism to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions, provides a competitive edge and potentially alters its relationship with its host
- There are a lot of new computational and experimental techniques to understand genes that are being transferred 
- Genomic context is a huge thing for HGT since there's an issue of accuracy of the technique and maintaining genomic context

**Possible Things to Investigate**
- [[scRNA-seq]] with HGT
- Study phage alterations in [[IBD]]

**Questions**
- How is HGT exploited in a lab?
- Which algos are mostly used to study HGT?
- Why are gram-positive bacteria hard to lyse?
- What exactly is a paired end read?
- How do binning methods work?''
