**Main Points**
- CNS vessels [[Blood brain barrier]] are continuous non-fenestrated vessels that also have a series of additional properties that allow them to tightly regulate movement of molecules, ions, and cells
- Loss of BBB barrier properties corresponds to neurological disorder
- Cells of the BBB
	- [[Endothelial cells]] held together by tight junctions to limit paracellular flux of solutes
	- [[Pericytes]] 
		- Regulate angiogenesis
		- Lead to deposition of the extracellular matrix
		- Wound healing
		- Import for regulating the formation of the BBB during development
		- Lack of pericytes --> up rate of transcytosis & increase expression of LAMs --> CNS immune infiltration
	- [[Astrocytes]] relay signals that regulate blood flow in response to neuronal activity
		- Produce factors that modulate endothelial functioning during development and adulthood
		- Secrete angiogenic factors that promote vascular growth
	- Perivascular [[macrophages]] can cross the BBB
- Tight junctions create a high resistance paracellular barrier to molecules and ions, causing polarity
- Basement membrane: provides an anchor for signaling proteins at the vasculature. Also provides an additional barrier for molecules and cells to cross
-  Transporters are important to identify targets to aid in drug delivery across the BBB
-  Many transport systems are targeted as trojan horses to aid in drug delivery to the [[CNS]]
-  Transcytosis goes up as a major component of BBB dysfunction during injury and disease
-  Healthy CNS: extremely low level of immune surveillance
-  Entry of a [[leukocyte]] from blood into a tissue requires leukocyte adhesion molecules (LAMs)
-  Expression of LAMs goes up during neuroinflammatory disease
-  [[MS]] is a [[T-cell]] mediated disease in which CD4 [[T-helper cells]] of the Th17 and Th1 phenotype play a fundamental role in pathogenesis
-  BBB actively shown to promote neuroinflammation by orchestrating immune responses during CNS-targeted auto-immune aggression
-  [[Stroke]] leads to increase in vasogenic edema caused by increase in BBB permeability
-  During ischemic stroke, increase in glutamate that binds to [[NMDA]] receptors. This excess is largely responsible for cytotoxic edema of neurons
-  Cerebral blood flow significantly reduces first in mild cognitive impairment and then in [[Alzheimers disease]]

**Possible Things to Investigate**
- Exhaustive approaches to understanding how different pathways regulate all aspects of the BBB

**Questions**
- Have transporters successfully been used yet in aiding drug delivery?
