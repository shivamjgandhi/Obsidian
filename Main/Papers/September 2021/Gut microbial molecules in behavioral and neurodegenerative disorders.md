**Main Points**
- Germ free and antibiotics treated animals exhibited altered levels of neurotrophic factors such as [[BDNF]] as well as abnormal [[neuropeptide]] & [[neurotransmitter]] levels
- [[Bile acids]]: products of host cholesterol metabolism that play a major role in fat digestion and signalling in energy metabolism
- Bacteria in the gut change hostwide bile acid levels
- Microbiome changes the ratio of active and inactive steroid levels through different degradation pathways
- Polyphenols are protective against depression
- MAMPS, SCFAs, secondary bile acids are intestinal signals leading to enterochromaffin cell stimulation
- No mechanistic connection between bacterial treatment, potential serotonin-regulation and depressive like phenotypes proven
- SSRI's interact with the vagus nerve
- High fiber diet leads to higher levels of SCFAs lead to lower levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Brain a major target for polyphenolic microbial metabolites 
- Polyphenols are able to cross the BBB, have positive effect on neuronal cultures through decreasing inflam response
- Therapeutic gut mb decrease in inflam [[LPS]] and increase in SCFAs and altered profile of bile acids for [[MS]]
- LPS activation of endothelial cells leads to cerebral cavernous malformations lead to seizure and stroke

**Possible things to investigate**
- Interested in understanding how [[Bile acids]] are involved in [[demyelination]] and [[neuroinflammation]]
- [[Enterochromaffin cells]]
- Learn about [[phenols]] art neuro diseases
- Interested in learning more about the [[vagus nerve]] activation
- Learn more about the [[Blood brain barrier]]
- Understanding how the microbiome relates to the brain leads to rational drug discovery platform directed to targets in GI tract

**Questions**
- How much do bacteria like *Salmonella* and *Escherichia* control [[amyloid]]?
- Why do they control [[amyloid]]? What's the pathway for it again?
- How do [[Bile acids]] affect the [[HPA axis]]?
- How does activation of the vagus nerve affect BDNF, GABA, and oxytocin?
- Why is tryptophan metabolism repeatedly important in the mb?
