**12-15: Enteric Pathogens cause a local inflammatory response and the development of protective immunity**
- Pathogens have developed mechanisms to cross the [[epithelium]]
- A defect in recognition of commensal microbiota by NOD2 seems to be important in [[Crohn's disease]]
- [[Epithelial cells]] also express members of the NOD-like receptor family that can form inflammasomes, which can cause tissue damage is present for long periods
- Autophagy is important for antigen processing in epithelial defense. When it's disrupted, bacteria cannot be contained and epithelial cells become stressed, leading to [[inflammation]]
- [[Paneth cells]] are found only in the small intestine, where they produce antimicrobial peptides. Defects in Paneth cell function lead to reduced bacterial defense and are believed to be important in susceptibility to [[IBD]]
- [[Goblet cells]] produce mucus in response to cytokines. This mucus is a formidable barrier to invasion


**12-16: Pathogens induce adaptive immune responses when innate defenses have been breached**
- If pathogenic bacteria and viruses gain access to the subepithelial space, they may interact with [[TLRs]] on inflammatory cells
- Together with the cascade of inflammatory mediators released by epithelial cells, this dramatically alters the environment of the mucosa and changed the behavior of local APCs

**12-17: Effector T-cell responses in the intestine protect the function of the epithelium**
- The aim of the protective immune system is tailored to preserving the integrity and function of the epithelial barrier

**12-18: The Mucosal Immune System must maintain tolerance to harmless foreign antigens**
- Oral tolerance develops to protein antigens that blunts immune response when the antigen is presented through some other route

**12-19: The normal intestine contains large quantities of bacteria that are required for health**
- The [[microbiome]] assists in metabolism of dietary constituents, degrade toxins, and produce essential cofactors like vitamin K
- These organisms can also inhibit the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that pathogens stimulate in epithelial cells needed for invasion
- Use of broad spectrum antibiotics can cause Clostridium difficile infection, which can be treated with [[fecal matter transplant]]

**12-20: Innate and adaptive immune systems control microbiota while preventing inflammation without compromising the ability to react to invaders**
- Commensal bacteria can cause infection if not controlled by the immune system
- [[IgA]] coats much of the commensal organisms that limits their adherence to and penetration of the epithelium
- The endotoxin on commensal bacteria are also sensitive to neutralization by gut enzymes leading to weaker immune activation, so if they do cross the epithelium they'll be neutralized
