**12-4: The Mucosal Immune System contains large numbers of effector lymphocytes even in the absence of disease**
- In the intestine, effector cells are found in the [[epithelium]] and [[Lamina propria]]
- The lymphoid component of the epi consists mainly of lymphocytes, virtually all CD8 T cells in the small intestine. Lamina propria has a variety
- T cells of the lamina propria in the small intestine express integrin alpha_4, beta_7 and chemokine receptor CCR9 which attracts them into the tissue from the bloodstream
- Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELS) are mostly CD8 T cells and express conventional alpha:beta form of CD8 or the CD8 alpha: alpha homodimer
- The healthy intestinal mucosa displays many characteristics of a chronic inflammatory response. This is essential for maintaining the beneficial symbiosis between the host and microbiome


**12-5: The circulation of lymphocytes within the mucosal immune system is controlled by tissue-specific adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors**
- Naive T cells and B cells circulating in the bloodstream are not predetermined as to which compartment of the immune sys they'll end up in. They enter [[Peyer's patches]] and mesenteric lymph nodes through high endothelial venules (HEVs)
- This process is controlled by CCL21 and CCL19, which are released from lymphoid tissues and bind the receptor CCR7 on naive lymphocytes
- Plasma cells are rarely found in Peyer's patches since the naive [[B-cells]] only differentiate into IgA-producing plasma cells once they've returned to the lamina propria
- Gut specific homing by antigen stimulated T and B cells is determined in large part by the expression of the adhesion molecule integrin alpha_4, beta_7
- Normally, only lymphocytes that first encounter antigen in a gut-associated secondary lymphoid organ are induced to express gut-specific homing receptors and integrins

**12-6: Priming of lymphocytes in one mucosal tissue may induce protective immunity at other mucosal surfaces**
- The common mucosal immune system consists of the overlaps in lymphocytes that go to other mucosal tissues such as the respiratory tract, urogenital tract, etc.

**12-7: Distinct populations of dendritic cells control mucosal immune responses**
- [[Dendritic cells]] are important for initiating and shaping immune responses in mucosal tissues, and are located both in secondary mucosal lymphoid organs and scattered throughout the mucosal surfaces
- Also abundant in the wall of the small intestine outside Peyer's patches, mainly in the lamina propria. Sample antigens from the lumen and surrounding tissue
- Collectively, the properties of intestinal dendritic cells result in a dominantly tolerogenic environment that prevents unnecessary and damaging reactions to foods and commensal microorganisms

**12-8: Macrophages and dendritic cells have different roles in mucosal immune responses**
- [[macrophages]] cannot migrate from the intestine to the draining lymph nodes and can't present antigen to naive T cells
- They scavenge cellular debris and microbes and may tune the activity of already primed T cells in the mucosa

**12-9: Antigen-presenting cells in the intestinal mucosa acquire antigen by a variety of routes**
- Some intestinal bacteria, such as enteropathogenic and enterohemolytic strains of E. coli, have specialized means of attaching to and invading epithelial cells, allowing them to enter the lamina propria directly
- Macrophages in the lamina propria may also participate in local antigen uptake by sending transepithelial dendrites that extend between epithelial cells and reach the lumen to sample bacteria
