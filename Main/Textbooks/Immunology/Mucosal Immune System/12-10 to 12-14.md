**12-10: Secretory IgA is the class of antibody associated with the mucosal immune system**
- IgA is the dominant class of [[antibody]] which is produced locally by [[plasma cells]] in the mucosal wall
- naive [[B-cells]] precursors of the IgA secreting mucosal plasma cells are activated in [[Peyer's patches]] and [[mesenteric lymph nodes]]
- IgA secreted into the gut lumen binds to the layer of mucus coating the epithelial surface via carb determinants in secretory component. Prevents invasion of pathogenic organisms and maintains homeostatic balance
- IgA can also neutralize bacterial [[lipopolysaccharides]] and [[viruses]] it encounters in the endosomes inside epithelial cells
- The formation of IgA antigen complexes can enhance uptake of luminal antigen by [[M-cells]] and local [[Dendritic cells]]
- Secretory IgA doesn't activate [[inflammation]] pathways which is important to not damage the small intestine

**12-11: T-independent processes can contribute to IgA production in some species**
- A significant proportion of intestinal IgA is derived from [[T-cell]] ind. B-cell activation and class switching
- The IgA antibodies produced in these T-cell-ind. responses are of limited diversity and of generally low affinity

**12-12: IgA deficinecy is relatively common in humans but may be compensated for by secretory IgM**

**12-13: The intestinal lamina propria contains antigen-experienced T cells and populations of unusual innate lymphoid cells**
- Lamina propria [[CD4 T cells]] secrete large amounts of cytokines such as [[IFN-gamma]] even in the absence of overt inflammation, which reflects the constant state of immune recognition of the microbiota and other environmental antigens that takes place in the intestine
- There isn't inflammation since the T cells are balanced by a lot of [[T reg cells]]
- The lamina propria also has [[innate lymphoid cells]] that produce cytokines that stimulate the epithelium to generate antimicrobial peptides that promote local defense against pathogens

**12-14: The intestinal epithelium is a unique compartment of the immune system**
- There are CD8 intraepithelial T cells (type a) that kill virus infected cells and secrete effector cytokines
- Type b cells will kill epithelial cells that show abnormal phenotype as a result of stress or infection
