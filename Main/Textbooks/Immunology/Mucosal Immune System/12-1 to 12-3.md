**12-1: The Mucosal Immune System Protexts the Internal Surface of the Body**
- Diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections, pulmonary tuuberculosis, measels, and worms all enter via the [[mucosal surface]]
- [[Commensal microorganisms]] live in symbiosis with the host
- Aberrant immune responses to commensal bacteria are thought to be the cause of Celiac and [[Crohn's disease]]


**12-2: Cells of the mucosal immune system are located both in anatomically defined compartments and scattered throughout mucosal tissue**
- [[Lamina propria]] - layer of connected tissue underlying surface epithelium of the mucosa
- [[Gut associated lymphoid tissue]] - organized secondary lymphoid tissue together with mesenteric and caudal lymph nodes
- Tonsils - large aggregates of lymphoid tissue covered by a layer of squamos epithelium and form a ring on the back of the mouth
- [[Peyer's patches]] - consist of a large number of [[B-cells]] follicles with small [[T-cell]] areas between and immediately below the follicles
- M-cells - directly exposed to microorganisms and the preferred route by which antigens enter the Peyer's patch from the lumen
- The tissue of the small intestine drain to the mesenteric lymph nodes

**12-3: The intestine has distinctive routes and mechanisms of antigen uptake**
- Transcytosis - the process through which material is transported through the interior of the cell in membrane bound vesicles to the basal membrane, where it's released to the extracellular space
- M cells have a very folded basal membrane that makes contact with local myeloid cells
- Dendritic cells move to the T-cell area of Peyer's patch due to chemokines released by epi cells. They along with T-cells then activate B cells for an immune response
