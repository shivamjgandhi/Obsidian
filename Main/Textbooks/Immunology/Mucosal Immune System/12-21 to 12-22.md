**12-21: The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in shaping intestinal and systemic immune function**
- In gnotobiotic mice, [[Peyer's patches]] don't develop normally, there aren't many mature [[T-cell]]s, and almost no cells secreting [[IgA]]
- Several autoimmune diseases are also more frequent in germ free animals

**12-22: Full immune responses to commensal bacteria provoke intestinal disease**
- Potentially aggressive T cells that can respond to [[Commensal microorganisms]] are present in normal animals but are kept in check by active regulation. If these mechanisms fail, unrestricted immune responses to commensal bacteria can lead to [[IBD]] such as [[Crohn's disease]]
- Patients with Crohn's and [[ulcerative colitis]] exhibit dysbiosis and have unusual populations of intestinal microbiota
